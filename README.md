# Computational Modelling Project

### Result: 24/25

## Outline of the project
The project focuses on building an agent-based model and run a simulation on a real-world phenomenon of a complex system based on students' interests. The fire forest simulation was performed on this project.

## Submission file included:
- Jupyter notebook
- PDF Report

## Jupyter Notebook and PDF report 
- Jupyter Notebook: The model was built on Google Colaboratory as a recommendation from the unit. The there are two variations of the fire forest agent-based model, one with fire fighters individually extinguish the fire, another with fire fighters extinguish the fire as a group.
- PDF report: The report included the introduction, model design, results and analysis (for two models), conclusion
